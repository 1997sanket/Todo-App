1. When we enable Spring Security, Spring provides us with form based authentication with username and password.
   So after entering correct username and password, Spring makes a session on the server and returns a cookie.
   Now for every request this cookie is sent to the spring, and thus we can access all apis. But the session is maintained 
   on the server, which is not very optimal. That's why we can go with Headers.

2. In Headers based authentication, for every request to the endpoint we are sending username and password in the header.

2. We can use Postman where we can put username and password
   and postman sends a string in the Authorization headers in which username and password is Base 64 encoded
	Eg : Basic esbasb1212

3. Now we can do the same when sending request from Angular, we just have to send Headers along with every request.


4. But when Headers are included in a request, there is something called as Pre request request sent to the server, and the \
   method for this request is OPTIONS.

5. So in Spring we need to override "WebSecurityConfigurerAdapters(HttpSecurity http)" method and do necessary changes
